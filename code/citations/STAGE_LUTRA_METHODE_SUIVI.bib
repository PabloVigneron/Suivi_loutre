  abstract = {Researchers have used occupancy, or probability of occupancy, as a response or state variable in a variety of studies (e.g., habitat modeling), and occupancy is increasingly favored by numerous state, federal, and international agencies engaged in monitoring programs. Recent advances in estimation methods have emphasized that reliable inferences can be made from these types of studies if detection and occupancy probabilities are simultaneously estimated. The need for temporal replication at sampled sites to estimate detection probability creates a trade-off between spatial replication (number of sample sites distributed within the area of interest/inference) and temporal replication (number of repeated surveys at each site). Here, we discuss a suite of questions commonly encountered during the design phase of occupancy studies, and we describe software (program GENPRES) developed to allow investigators to easily explore design trade-offs focused on particularities of their study system and sampling limitations. We illustrate the utility of program GENPRES using an amphibian example from Greater Yellowstone National Park, USA.},

  abstract = {La détection d'anomalies est une tâche cruciale qui a suscité l'intérêt de plusieurs travaux de recherche dans les communautés d'apprentissage automatique et fouille de données. La complexité de cette tâche dépend de la nature des données, de la disponibilité de leur étiquetage et du cadre applicatif dont elles s'inscrivent. Dans le cadre de cette thèse, nous nous intéressons à cette problématique pour les données complexes et particulièrement pour les séries temporelles uni et multi-variées. Le terme "anomalie" peut désigner une observation qui s'écarte des autres observations au point d'éveiller des soupçons. De façon plus générale, la problématique sous-jacente (aussi appelée détection de nouveautés ou détection des valeurs aberrantes) vise à identifier, dans un ensemble de données, celles qui différent significativement des autres, qui ne se conforment pas à un "comportement attendu" (à définir ou à apprendre automatiquement), et qui indiquent un processus de génération différent. Les motifs "anormaux" ainsi détectés se traduisent souvent par de l'information critique. Nous nous focalisons plus précisément sur deux aspects particuliers de la détection d'anomalies à partir de séries temporelles dans un mode non-supervisé. Le premier est global et consiste à ressortir des séries relativement anormales par rapport une base entière. Le second est dit contextuel et vise à détecter localement, les points anormaux par rapport à la structure de la série étudiée. Pour ce faire, nous proposons des approches d'optimisation à base de clustering pondéré et de déformation temporelle pour la détection globale ; et des mécanismes à base de modélisation matricielle pour la détection contextuelle. Enfin, nous présentons une série d'études empiriques sur des données publiques pour valider les approches proposées et les comparer avec d'autres approches connues dans la littérature. De plus, une validation expérimentale est fournie sur un problème réel, concernant la détection de séries de prix aberrants sur les pneumatiques, pour répondre aux besoins exprimés par le partenaire industriel de cette thèse},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

  abstract = {The records of one pack of Otter Hounds hunting in southwest England are examined for the period 1907 to 1971 as well as the records of all packs active in Britain between 1950 and 1976. The hunting success per unit effort varies from year to year depending on changes in hunting conditions but longer term changes can also be identified. The hunting success of the Culmstock Otter Hounds (hunting in parts of south-west England) increased steadily from 1907 to 1956 but in most of England and south Wales the success rate of the hunts declined rapidly after 1957. There was also a decline in success in northern England and southern Scotland but to a lesser extent, while in north Wales and Eire, there is no evidence for a decline.These changes are considered to reflect changes in otter populations but the extent of the decline in hunting success (to between 37\% and 55\% of previous levels in the southern hunts) is probably less than the actual decline in otter numbers. There are no signs of a recovery in the population but indications of a continuing decline up to 1976.The reason for the increasing population in the first half of the century in south-west England is probably the decrease in persecution since the nineteenth century. A variety of causes for the crash in the late 1950s are considered and the factor most likely to be responsible is the introduction of the dieldrin group of insecticides in 1956. Use of these compounds has been increasingly restricted since 1963 and the possible reasons for the failufe of the otter population to recover are listed but no firm conclusions can be drawn as yet.},

We revised and supplemented the historical distribution records of the Eurasian otter using interviews and questionnaires. The species distribution model was used to reconstruct the distribution pattern of Eurasian otter in Northeast China across the last 70 years, and the correlation between the change in distribution pattern and environmental factors was calculated. Our results show that the distribution of otters in Northeast China has decreased by 46~\% and the occurrence point record has decreased by 60~\% over the past 70 years. We found that the spatial distribution pattern of suitable habitats for otters is positively correlated with precipitation in the driest season and percentage of forest land, and negatively correlated with density of residential spots and percentage of cultivated land. In terms of temporal changes in distribution, the distribution of suitable habitats for otters may shrink in time affected by density of residential spots and percentage of cultivated land. Over the past 70 years, otter distribution has declined mainly in low-elevation plains. Controlling human disturbances, especially at the border between mountains and plains, could be key to the recovery of populations of otters. Planning for the protection of freshwater ecosystems in the Greater Khingan Mountains should be prioritized.},

  abstract = {Aim To analyse the geographical patterns in the composition and diversity of otter's (Lutra lutra L.) diet and their relationship with climatic characteristics. Location European freshwater habitats under Mediterranean and temperate climatic regimes. Methods Thirty-seven otter diet studies were reviewed, twenty-one from temperate and sixteen from Mediterranean areas. All studies were based on spraint analysis and their results expressed as relative frequency of occurrence of seven main prey categories. Principal Component Analysis was performed to extract the main gradients of diet composition. Pearson's correlation and t-tests were used to assess the relationship between diet characteristics (composition, diversity and taxonomic richness) and geographical and climatic variables. Results A clear latitudinal gradient in diet composition was observed. Otter diet was more diverse and featured more prey classes in southern localities, while the species was more piscivorous towards the north, where it predated upon a higher number of fish families. This pattern was similar when temperate and Mediterranean localities of Europe were compared. Mediterranean otters behaved as more generalist predators than temperate ones, relying less on fish, and more on aquatic invertebrates and reptiles. Main conclusions Geographical differences in otter feeding ecology in Europe seem to be related with the two contrasted climatic conditions affecting prey populations. The otter can act as a highly specialized piscivorous predator in temperate freshwater ecosystems, which do not suffer a dry season and have a comparatively stable water regime compared to Mediterranean ones. However, the unpredictable prey availability in Mediterranean areas, affected by strong spatial and temporal water shortages, favours a diversification of the otter's diet.},

  abstract = {1. Non-invasive genetic sampling (NGS) of hair and faeces has become an important tool for monitoring wildlife populations, but many managers question the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of these methods for long-term monitoring. To address this question, more studies are needed that simultaneously evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of multiple NGS designs in the same study area. 2. In 2003–2004, we carried out an experimental study of NGS for a small brown bear Ursus arctos population established by translocation in the Italian Alps. We evaluated and compared the effectiveness and efficiency of three NGS approaches including two systematic designs, baited hair traps and transect sampling of hair and faeces, and opportunistic collection of faecal and hair samples. Effectiveness was evaluated in terms of the number of samples collected, bears identified, genotyping success and error rate, detection frequencies, individual movement and spatial distribution of the species. We also evaluated the suitability of the data collected for population size estimation using single- and multi-session approaches. Efficiency was assessed by calculating total cost/genotyped sample, cost/unique bear identified and cost/bear sample. 3. During 2 years of sampling, 1164 samples and 15 unique genotypes were obtained. From these genotypes, we documented reproduction, an increase in the minimum population size of bears in the study area and important information on specific bears causing damages to property. 4. The optimal sampling strategy combined systematic hair trapping and opportunistic sampling, as the pooled data set efficiently provided large sample quantities, the highest number of identified bears, multiple individual detections, information on bear distribution and suitable data for population size estimation. 5. We provide an example of how the efficiency of NGS monitoring can be improved by integrating sampling into routine duties of existing field personnel. 6. Synthesis and applications. This study provides baseline data for monitoring brown bears in the Italian Alps and has important implications for NGS of other small populations in human-dominated landscapes. Conservation of small populations in such habitats will benefit from multiple strategies that obtain critical demographic, spatial and genetic information in a cost-effective manner.},

  abstract = {Recent technological and methodological advances have revolutionized wildlife monitoring. Although most biodiversity monitoring initiatives are geared towards focal species of conservation concern, researchers are increasingly studying entire communities, specifically the spatiotemporal drivers of community size and structure and interactions among species. This has resulted in the emergence of multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) as a promising and efficient approach for the study of community ecology. Given the potential of MSOMs for conservation and management action, it is critical to know whether study design and model assumptions are consistent with inference objectives. This is especially true for studies that are designed for a focal species but can give insights about a community. Here, we review the recent literature on MSOMs, identify areas of improvement in the multi-species study workflow, and provide a reference model for best practices for focal species and community monitoring study design. We reviewed 92 studies published between 2009 and early 2018, spanning 27 countries and a variety of taxa. There is a consistent under-reporting of details that are central to determining the adequacy of designs for generating data that can be used to make inferences about community-level patterns of occupancy, including the spatial and temporal extent, types of detectors used, covariates considered, and choice of field methods and statistical tools. This reporting bias could consequently result in skewed estimates, affecting conservation actions and management plans. On the other hand, comprehensive reporting is likely to help researchers working on MSOMs assess the robustness of inferences, in addition to making strides in terms of reproducibility and reusability of data. We use our literature review to inform a roadmap with best practices for MSOM studies, from simulations to design considerations and reporting, for the collection of new data as well as those involving existing datasets.},

  abstract = {The conservation of carnivores (order Carnivora) can lead to the conservation of other species as well as entire ecosystems since they play an important ecosystemic role. However, their predatory behaviour has caused many of these species to experience marked population declines worldwide and they may therefore face greater anthropogenic threats than other animal groups. To examine the conservation status, population trends, distribution patterns, habitats and threats of all extant species belonging to this order (N\,=\,290), we collected data from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's Red List. In addition, we calculated the Red List Index (RLI) to measure the change in extinction risk of species over time. Carnivores are more threatened than mammals in general (26.9\% of endangered species vs. 22.7\%) and have a significantly higher proportion of species with declining populations (48.3\% vs. 31.9\%). Eupleridae, Ursidae and Felidae families have the worst conservation status. Between the 1990s and 2000s, most families suffered a considerable decline in their RLI value, the most notable being Felidae. The greatest numbers of threatened carnivore species are found in forest, shrubland and grassland habitats. East and South Asia hold great numbers of carnivore species as well as the highest proportion of threatened and declining species. Hunting and trapping of terrestrial animals, along with habitat loss (caused by deforestation and agricultural expansion), pose the main threats to the Carnivora order. Our findings indicate that, within mammals, the conservation of carnivores should be a priority, and conservation measures directed at this group should be undertaken or increased as a matter of urgency.},

  abstract = {The Eurasian otter Lutra lutra and its resting places are protected by EU and UK legislation. Consultant ecologists must identify resting sites so they can be protected during developments. Currently, consultants usually use field-signs, but radio-telemetry studies indicate this may be unreliable. Camera-traps could be used to identify resting sites within the consultancy industry. This research aims to improve field-sign and camera-trap survey methods to identify otter resting sites. Firstly, camera-trap methodology is considered. Arrays of camera-traps were used with continuous CCTV as a control so the effect of variables on detection success of mammal passes could be modelled. A six-year camera-trap study of an active breeding and resting site was analysed to optimise set-up. Distance from the camera-trap had a negative effect on trigger probability but a positive effect on registration probability (i.e. the probability that an image or video is captured given a trigger). Slower animals had greater trigger and registration probabilities while otters had reduced detection after immersion in water. A reduction of video clip duration, and exclusion of daytime monitoring would have reduced the amount of time watching video footage with minimal data loss. These findings guided a camera-trap study of 26 potential resting sites where field evidence was recorded at 21-day intervals. The camera-trap data was also used to identify rests and any relationships between resting and field evidence were investigated. A rest could only be observed on CT footage and was defined as an otter being within a structure for ≥ 15min. According to this criteria, six of the 26 sites were resting sites, with 95\% of rests occurring in winter and spring. Latrines were exclusive to resting sites, and presence of bedding material was strongly related to resting sites. Data simulations calculated that a period of 35 days of camera-trapping in winter, repeated in spring would have a 95\% probability of detecting a rest. These findings contribute to the evidence-base for guidelines for ecologists to identify resting sites as required by law. The patterns of otter activity, behaviour and field-signs provide a comparison for further studies. The research focusses on otter, but the approaches and principles could be applied more widely.},

In the ensuing decades, the SOM and its hierarchical modeling extensions have become mainstays of quantitative ecology, and estimating occupancy rates has become one of the most common applications of ecological field data. Here, we review 364 peer-reviewed articles published between 2019–2021 that estimated occupancy. We first document broad patterns in study design and statistical methods to provide educators, developers of methodology and software, and ecologists with a clear picture of the landscape of methodologies used to estimate animal occupancy. Second, we conduct a focused review of a subset of 98 papers that applied the hierarchical SOM, drawing from methodological literature to identify discrepancies between SOM applications and methodological best practices. We discuss limits to statistical power, issues with model checking and model selection procedures, potential problems arising from unmodeled non-independence, and reproducibility. We highlight areas of rapid advancement in interpreting animal occupancy related to animal movement, imperfect detection, and the occupancy–density relationship. We aim to help readers understand the landscape of methods available, motivate shifts toward robust and reproducible science, and inspire new software and methodological research.},

  abstract = {1. Predicting the current and potential distributions of established invasive species is critical for evaluating management options, but methods for differentiating these distributions have received little attention. In particular, there is uncertainty among invasive species managers about the value of information from incidental sightings compared to data from designed field surveys. This study compares the two approaches, and develops a unifying framework, using the case of invasive sambar deer Cervus unicolor in Victoria, Australia. 2. We first used 391 incidental sightings of sambar deer and 12 biophysical variables to construct a presence-only habitat suitability model using Maxent. We then used that model to stratify field sampling, with proportionately greater sampling of cells with high predicted habitat suitability. Field sampling, consisting of faecal pellet surveys, sign surveys and camera trapping, was conducted in 80 4-km2 grid cells. A Bayesian state-space occupancy model was used to predict probability of suitable habitat from the field data. 3. The Maxent and occupancy models predicted similar spatial distributions of habitat suitability for sambar deer in Victoria and there was a strong positive correlation between the rankings of cells by the two approaches. The congruence of the two models suggests that any spatial and detection biases in the presence-only data were relatively unimportant in our study. 4. We predicted the extent of suitable habitat from the occupancy model using a threshold that gave a false negative error rate of 0·05. The current distribution was the suitable habitat within a kernel that had a 99·5\% chance of including the presence locations pooled from incidental sightings and field surveys: the potential distribution was suitable habitat outside that kernel. Several discrete areas of potential distribution were identified as priorities for surveillance monitoring with the aim of detecting and managing incursions of sambar deer. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our framework enables managers to robustly estimate the current and potential distributions of established invasive species using either presence-only and/or presence–absence data. Managers can then focus control and/or containment actions within the current distribution and establish surveillance monitoring to detect incursions within the potential distribution.},

The Random Knight's Tour and Sequential Swap algorithms generate very similar results for the large Vanuatu matrix, and for other presence-absence matrices we tested.

  abstract = {1. Studies aimed at estimating species site occupancy while accounting for imperfect detection are common in ecology and conservation. Often there is interest in assessing whether occupancy differs between two samples, for example, two points in time, areas or habitats. To ensure that meaningful results are obtained in such studies, attention has to be paid to their design, and power analysis is a useful means to accomplish this. 2. We provide tools for conducting power analysis in studies aimed at detecting occupancy differences under imperfect detection and explore associated design trade-offs. We derive a formula in closed form that conveniently allows determining the sample size required to detect a difference in occupancy with a given power. Because this formula is based on asymptotic approximations, we use simulations to assess its performance, at the same time comparing that of different significance tests. 3. We show that the closed-formula performs well in a wide range of scenarios, providing a useful lower sample size bound. For the simulated scenarios, a Wald test on the probability scale was the most powerful test among those evaluated. 4. We found that choosing the number of repeat visits based on existing recommendations for single-season studies will often be a good approach in terms of minimizing the effort required to achieve a given power. 5. We demonstrate that our results and discussion are applicable regardless of whether independence or Markovian dependence is assumed in the occupancy status of sites between seasons, and illustrate their utility when designing to detect a trend in multiple-season studies. 6. Assessing differences in species occupancy is relevant in many ecological and conservation applications. For the outcome of these monitoring efforts to be meaningful and so to avoid wasting the often limited resources, survey design has to be carefully addressed to ensure that the relevant differences can be indeed detected and that this is achieved in the most efficient way. Here, we provide guidance and tools of immediate practical use for the design of such studies, including code to conduct power analysis.},

  abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {Data obtained from the dissection of 1067 otters Lutra lutra were used to compare the causes of mortality in relation to age composition, time trends, and regions. Age determination was based on the analysis of incremental cementum lines in teeth. Major causes of mortality of otters were traffic accidents (69.9\%), followed by natural deaths (6.6\%), deaths in fish-traps (6\%), hunting (4.1\%), and other violent events (4.4\%). No significant differences in mortality structure between the sexes were found. Resulting from a log-linear and a contrast analysis, significant differences in frequencies of mortality causes in relation to different time periods, regions and age classes of otters were observed. The frequency of otters dying from hunting or diseases was highest in youngest (AC I) and oldest (AC V) otters. Generally, the greatest differences between age classes resulted from comparison of frequencies of traffic-mortality, hunting, and fish-traps. Concerning time trends, the greatest differences were found in the periods before and after 1990. In addition to the increase of traffic-mortality, hunting and deaths in fish-traps influenced the distribution of mortality in different time periods. In eastern Germany, there is a clear difference in mortality between northern and southern regions. This results mainly from commercial fish-trapping being more common at the northern coast and lakes. However, in all different subsamples of time, region or age-class, traffic-killed otters amounted to {$>$}50\% of all otters found dead.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and maintaining biodiversity are crucial for the ecological balance and overall health of ecosystems. Detecting anomalies in species distribution patterns is essential for identifying areas of concern and implementing timely conservation measures. This paper introduces an approach to detect anomalies in spatiotemporal species activity data by integrating time series analysis, machine learning techniques, and spatial statistics. Our method identifies distribution patterns of various species and groups regions with similar patterns, enabling the segmentation of the study area into distinct categories. Within these categorized regions, we apply a combination of clustering algorithms and outlier detection techniques to pinpoint anomalous behaviors in species distribution. In order to confirm the reliability of our findings, we cross-reference them with verified data acquired through field observations or other credible data sources. These corroborations indicate that anomalies are frequently indicative of sudden variations in species numbers or unexpected alterations in spatial distribution at certain places and times. To gain a more robust understanding of how species are distributed, we curate a data set that excludes these anomalous observations and use it to develop a predictive algorithm. Our analysis shows that a predictive model trained on this refined, anomaly-free dataset achieves a lower normalized mean square error (NMSE), which suggests a higher level of predictive accuracy as compared to a model trained on data containing anomalies. Utilizing this methodology can facilitate the creation of effective conservation plans and contribute to more sustainable ecosystem management.},

Policy decisions require comprehensive, spatially explicit information on species’ distributions and threats. We present an analysis of the conservation status of 14,669 European terrestrial, freshwater and marine species (ca. 10\% of the continental fauna and flora), including all vertebrates and selected groups of invertebrates and plants. Our results reveal that 19\% of European species are threatened with extinction, with higher extinction risks for plants (27\%) and invertebrates (24\%) compared to vertebrates (18\%). These numbers exceed recent IPBES (Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services) assumptions of extinction risk. Changes in agricultural practices and associated habitat loss, overharvesting, pollution and development are major threats to biodiversity. Maintaining and restoring sustainable land and water use practices is crucial to minimize future biodiversity declines.},

  abstract = {Semi-aquatic mammals are dependent upon streams and riparian areas, which are a product of the landscapes they drain. Both local stream morphology and surrounding land use are likely to have important influences on current occupancy of semi-aquatic mammals and potentially affect future geographic distributions. We identified aspects of the riparian system and stream structure at multiple scales that relate to the presence of river otter (Lontra canadensis) and mink (Neovison vison) to better understand how changing landscapes affect occupancy dynamics of these semi-aquatic mammals and to facilitate future monitoring and management. We estimated multi-season occupancy using 103 sites sampled over 6 seasonal sampling periods in southern Illinois, USA (44,526 km2) during 2012–2014. We hypothesized river otter and mink occupancy were related to multiple aspects of landscape and local habitat attributes including land cover, water availability, human disturbance, and stream characteristics. Occupancy of river otter was predicted by large stream size, less developed area near the stream site, and proximity to areas with reintroduced or remnant populations of river otter. Mink were more likely to occupy sites with small streams and decreased water availability near the site. However, top models for both species had low weights and high uncertainty for multiple variables. Habitat-based models may not be the best predictors of occupancy for these carnivores because they are more likely to respond to prey diversity or availability, but landscape changes that decrease natural water availability and increase human disturbance to the stream at the local scale are likely to negatively affect river otter. © 2019 The Authors.

Long-term studies on the ability of regenerated secondary forests to sustain biodiversity compared with primary forests have been little explored. South Korea has experienced rapid urbanization and rapid forest regeneration. In this study, we asked two questions: (1) Does secondary forest development alleviate the negative impacts of urbanization on an apex predator; and (2) Can we elucidate a land use planning balance between urbanization and biodiversity conservation using scenario analysis? We studied the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) population in South Korea. We applied generalized linear mixed models to five national otter surveys from 1994 to 2019 with 18 environmental variables. Based on the most parsimonious model, we developed 10 scenarios with three patterns of urbanization (dispersed, clustered, and no further urbanization) with or without forest development or with forest degeneration. The most parsimonious model showed that otter occurrences steadily increased with greater forest density, but were negatively correlated with the percentage of urban areas. The scenarios suggested that diffused urban development had a less negative impact on otter distribution than clustered urban areas. Developed forests considerably alleviated the negative impacts of urbanization. In sample sub-basins, scenarios showed that even without further urbanization, otters will take more than six years to occur with the current forest development trends. Hence, sustainable urban planning should include strategic spatial planning for forest development and preservation.},

  abstract = {(Article written in French, summary in pdf) In many scientific disciplines, experimental studies or field monitoring ensure the data collection. The data is stored on raw files with an intuitive format, easily entered by the experimenter. However, this raw format is rarely directly compatible with the analysis of the collected data and the data may be erroneous; it is then necessary to carry out a formatting and quality control. Faced with the increasing number of ever more massive raw data sets, the discipline of digital for life sciences has developed. Computer programming represents a precious help for modellers since it allows the automation of data formatting and data cleaning. The data formatting makes it possible to obtain a format that will be directly used in the analyses. Automation also enables to avoid errors generated by manual formatting, such as typing errors and omissions. Data cleaning, a term used in computer science, corresponds to the data quality control according to the criteria provided by the modeller. The modeller knows the range of values of the data obtained and the possible errors produced. In this article, we present a collaboration between computer scientist and modeller in the framework of animal abundance monitoring. The data collected on several sheets of a spreadsheet had to be gathered on one sheet and their quality had to be checked. The various functionalities of the program carrying out this verification were implemented using the “agile” method, a computer development method consisting of sprints. After a version was provided, a new sprint defined the next functionality to be implemented by the computer scientist in a new version of the program. The first version allows the appropriation of the dataset by the computer scientist thanks to the formatting functionality. A more advanced version manages the absence of data, then others check the collected data quality and reports the processing of detected anomalies, data missing or erroneous or outside a specified range, in a text file. This computer program has been explained so that it can be re-appropriated and re-used, the full version is deposited in GitHub. The link is given in conclusion.},

Our results provide four important insights. First, the index is efficient in discriminating sites in good condition from sites experiencing anthropogenic disturbances. Second, according to the index, the ecological state of French riverine fish assemblages is rather poor, as around half of the assessed sites, thought to reflect the diverse conditions within the French riverine system, are significantly impaired. Third, according to the index, there is no noticeable amelioration through time of sites fish assemblage structure and function despite management efforts initiated two decades ago to comply with the EU’s 2000 Water Framework Directive. Fourth, the index might start being influenced by climate change as early signs of response to warming are happening since the last 10 yr. According to the FBI, the current efforts for improving the biological condition of riverine systems in France are not yet creating desired outcomes.},

  abstract = {1. The abundance and distribution of a species are affected by processes which operate at multiple scales. Large-scale dynamics are increasingly recognized in conservation responses such as metapopulation management, transfrontier protected areas and softening the agricultural matrix. Landscape-scale monitoring is needed both to inform and judge their efficacy. In this Special Profile we address some of the challenges presented by monitoring at the landscape scale, how models of species distribution can be used to inform policy, and we discuss how monitoring at the global-scale could be approached. 2. Collecting data over a large area is inherently costly, so methods which can provide robust information at low-cost are particularly valuable. We present two papers which test low-cost approaches against more data-hungry methods (indices of abundance vs. direct density estimates, and species distribution models built from presence-only vs. presence/absence data). 3. Occupancy modelling is a useful approach for landscape-scale monitoring due to the relatively low-cost of collecting detection/non-detection data. We discuss challenges, such as non-random sampling locations and periodical unavailability for detection, in using detection/non-detection data for monitoring species distribution. Such data can also provide estimates of abundance and we show how existing models have been modified to allow the abundance of multiple species to be estimated simultaneously. 4. Models of species distribution can be used to project likely future scenarios and thus inform conservation planning where distributions are likely to change because of climate change or changing disturbance patterns. We also discuss how an optimization framework can be used to make efficient management decisions for invasive species management in the light of imperfect information. 5. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring is needed for many purposes including auditing past management decisions and informing future choices. Much monitoring data are collected at the site scale, although management authorities increasingly recognize landscape-scale dynamics. Recent global targets for conservation require monitoring which can report trends at the global-scale. Integrating data collected at a variety of scales to draw robust inference at the scale required is a challenge which deserves more attention from applied ecologists.},

  abstract = {1 Many aspects of human behaviour impact on ecological systems. Ecologists therefore need information on changes in these behaviours and are increasingly using methods more familiar to social scientists. 2 Understanding patterns of wildlife harvesting is important for assessing the sustainability of harvests. Interviews are commonly used in which informants are asked to summarize their activities over a period of time. However, few studies have investigated the reliability of such data, the usefulness of interviews for monitoring trends, and how their information content can be maximized. 3 We carried out rapid assessment interviews with villagers in Madagascar about the quantity, timing and spatial patterns of crayfish Astacoides granulimanus and firewood collection. We compared the results with information from daily interviews with the same informants. We used mixed models to investigate how accurately people reported their activities in the rapid assessment interviews, and estimated the probability of detecting a change in harvesting from two such interviews using a Bayesian approach. 4 The interviews provided reliable information on quantities, effort, and the spatial pattern of harvesting. Simulations suggested the interviews would detect changes in catches and harvesting effort with reasonable power; for example, a 20\% change in the amount of time spent crayfish harvesting could be detected with 90\% power. Power is higher when the same informants are questioned in repeat interviews. 5 Synthesis and applications. Ecologists are increasingly using social techniques and it is vital that they are subject to rigorous testing to ensure robustness in trend detection. This study suggests that interviews can be used to monitor changes in harvesting patterns by resource users, but whether the power is adequate will depend on the needs of the study. To maximize the power of interviews, informants should be interviewed independently and the same informants interviewed in subsequent years.},

  abstract = {Many small carnivore populations are declining and urgently require evidence-based conservation. Despite their ecological importance, the spatial dynamics of small carnivores remain understudied compared to large carnivores. The Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) represents a rare example of a recovering small carnivore population in Europe, following nearly a century of decline. However, recovery remains slow in some regions, with populations still vulnerable across much of the species' range. In France, spatial and temporal heterogeneity in data availability has hindered the development of accurate, high-resolution distribution maps, limiting insights into the drivers of this recovery and the factors constraining populations. Here, we mapped the evolution of otter distribution in France from 2009 to 2023 using an integrated species distribution model. This approach combined opportunistic occurrence data and standardized detection/non-detection data from diverse monitoring programs while accounting for non-detection and environmental variability. Our results revealed an expanding distribution, including the reconnection of historical population cores and the emergence of active colonization fronts spanning multiple regions. While occurrence was slightly higher in salmonid-rich rivers with forested banks at broader scales, habitat preferences varied significantly at regional scales, indicating that otters are now occupying more diverse habitats. This study demonstrates the potential of integrating heterogeneous data sources to study carnivore distributions. Our findings provide valuable insights into the status and trends of Eurasian otters in France and offer a framework for guiding effective national-scale conservation efforts.},

  abstract = {Nondetection of a species at a site does not imply that the species is absent unless the probability of detection is 1. We propose a model and likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when detection probabilities are 1. The model provides a flexible framework enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities (0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring program, Frog-watch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo amer-icanus), a 44\% increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed, and as 0.85 for spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.}

  abstract = {Few species are likely to be so evident that they will always be detected when present. Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark–recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occiden-talis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Min-nesota, USA.}

Null models provide a powerful statistical approach to test for patterns using functional character information. A combined null model/functional character approach provides the ability to distinguish between the effect of competition and environmental filtering on species turnover. We measured 13 functional characters relating directly to resource use for the fish species found in French lakes. We combined this functional character data with a null model approach to test whether co-occurring species overlapped more or less than expected at random for four primary niche axes. We used an environmentally constrained null model approach to determine if the same mechanisms were responsible for species turnover at different sections of the altitudinal gradient. Functional diversity indices were used to examine the variation in functional character diversity with altitude, as a test of the hypothesis that competitive intensity decreases with increasing environmental adversity. The unconstrained null model showed that environmental filtering was the dominant influence on species turnover between lakes. In the constrained null model, there was much less evidence for environmental filtering, emphasising the strong effect of altitude on turnover in functional character values between local communities. Different results were obtained for low-altitude and high-altitude lake subsets, with more evidence for the effect of environmental filtering being found in the high-altitude lakes. This demonstrates that different processes may influence species turnover throughout an environmental gradient. Functional diversity values showed a slight decrease with altitude, indicating that there was only weak evidence that competitive intensity decreased with increasing altitude. Variation resource availability and environmental stress probably cause the observed turnover in functional characters along the altitudinal gradient, though the effects of dispersal limitation and species introductions in high-altitude lakes cannot be ruled out.},

A minimum of 16-years data was collected on each river until 2002. At a series of sites in each study river, the percentages which were positive for otters and the number of spraints per sprainting site were recorded and combined to produce an annual index of population. One western river, naturally recolonized, showed rapid early population growth for 5 years, followed by slower growth, while growth was steadier in 2 catchments which already held some otters at the beginning of the study. Colonization on the eastern rivers was slower, with greater fluctuations over time. Annual population growth rates were estimated at 1–7\%, higher in the earlier years. A strategy for annual monitoring of otters is recommended.}

  abstract = {1. Species’ distribution modelling relies on adequate data sets to build reliable statistical models with high predictive ability. However, the money spent collecting empirical data might be better spent on management. A less expensive source of species’ distribution information is expert opinion. This study evaluates expert knowledge and its source. In particular, we determine whether models built on expert knowledge apply over multiple regions or only within the region where the knowledge was derived. 2. The case study focuses on the distribution of the brush-tailed rock-wallaby Petrogale penicillata in eastern Australia. We brought together from two biogeographically different regions substantial and well-designed field data and knowledge from nine experts. We used a novel elicitation tool within a geographical information system to systematically collect expert opinions. The tool utilized an indirect approach to elicitation, asking experts simpler questions about observable rather than abstract quantities, with measures in place to identify uncertainty and offer feedback. Bayesian analysis was used to combine field data and expert knowledge in each region to determine: (i) how expert opinion affected models based on field data and (ii) how similar expert-informed models were within regions and across regions. 3. The elicitation tool effectively captured the experts’ opinions and their uncertainties. Experts were comfortable with the map-based elicitation approach used, especially with graphical feedback. Experts tended to predict lower values of species occurrence compared with field data. 4. Across experts, consensus on effect sizes occurred for several habitat variables. Expert opinion generally influenced predictions from field data. However, south-east Queensland and north-east New South Wales experts had different opinions on the influence of elevation and geology, with these differences attributable to geological differences between these regions. 5. Synthesis and applications. When formulated as priors in Bayesian analysis, expert opinion is useful for modifying or strengthening patterns exhibited by empirical data sets that are limited in size or scope. Nevertheless, the ability of an expert to extrapolate beyond their region of knowledge may be poor. Hence there is significant merit in obtaining information from local experts when compiling species’ distribution models across several regions.},

  abstract = {Assessing and monitoring populations of elusive species frequently rely on the identification of indirect signs such as faeces. The absence of signs does not necessarily denote the absence of a species, thus, the ability to determine the presence/absence is susceptible to false negative results. The probability of detection is central to the interpretation and utility of data from field sign surveys. A low probability of detection may introduce considerable error into distribution patterns, resulting in inaccurate ecological conclusions. We used a systematic resampling approach, based on sequential spatial replication of spraint surveys, to investigate the probability of detecting Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra L.) with different survey designs. This included the standard otter transect survey methodology, which is widely used in conservation and scientific studies. In particular, we focus on the impact of applying broad scale population assessment techniques at smaller spatial scales. Fortnightly catchment-level otter surveys were undertaken on four lowland rivers in South Wales, over a period of two years. GIS was used to construct binary vectors for each survey, denoting the presence (1) or absence (0) of otters at each 50m section of river. Vectors from all study rivers were pooled and resampled to test the different survey designs. The mean probability of detecting otters based on the standard protocol of a single 600m transect survey was very low (0.26±0.01 SE). The best way of obtaining a detection probability of 0.8 was to undertake three repeat surveys at two separate sites, using a transect of 800–1000m. We demonstrate how sequentially collected spatial data can be analysed to determine the reliability of field sign surveys. Increasing the number of visits and study sites was a more efficient means of improving detection power than increasing transect length alone. The study emphasises the importance of determining detection probabilities and designing field sign surveys according to study scale and objectives. Our findings question the value of survey designs that aim to provide an instantaneous assessment of species presence/absence.},

  abstract = {The influence of riparian habitat structure and fish availability on otter Lutra lutra marking activity was studied at the head of the Guadalete river (southern Spain). Otter habitat in the study area could be ordered along two gradients in structural properties (altitude, stream order, channel form, water current, bank vegetation), water quality and bankside plant species composition. Generally, higher altitude sites had more dense bankside vegetation cover and better water quality. The dominant upstream bankside plant assemblage consisted of species such as Rubus sp., Salix spp., and Arundo donax, which provided secure shelter for otters. In contrast, at downstream sites the typical plant assemblage was Tamarix africana, Nerium oleander and helophytes, overall bankside cover was lower but wider and the water was more eutrophic. Otter sprainting activity was correlated with this gradient, being higher in downstream sites, especially in areas dominated by short vegetation and scarce human presence. Similarly, fish biomass was greater downstream. A strong positive correlation was observed between otter sprainting activity and larger fish size. Thus, the variability in otter marking intensity along the upper Guadalete seemed to be more dependent on fish availability, and secondly on human disturbance, than on particular riparian habitat features, including the species composition of vegetation growing on the river banks. Implications for conservation management of otters in Mediterranean areas are discussed.},

  abstract = {Abstract: In the face of limited funding, knowledge, and time for action, conservation efforts often rely on shortcuts for the maintenance of biodiversity. The umbrella species concept—proposed as a way to use species requirements as a basis for conservation planning—has recently received growing attention. We reviewed the literature to evaluate the concept's general usefulness. An umbrella species is defined as a species whose conservation is expected to confer protection to a large number of naturally co-occurring species. This concept has been proposed as a tool for determining the minimum size for conservation areas, selecting sites to be included in reserve networks, and setting minimum standards for the composition, structure, and processes of ecosystems. Among the species suggested as potential umbrellas, most are large mammals and birds, but invertebrates are increasingly being considered. Eighteen research papers, most of which were based on hypothetical reserves or conservation networks, have provided evaluations of umbrella species schemes. These show that single-species umbrellas cannot ensure the conservation of all co-occurring species because some species are inevitably limited by ecological factors that are not relevant to the umbrella species. Moreover, they provide evidence that umbrella species from a given higher taxon may not necessarily confer protection to assemblages from other taxa. On the other hand, multi-species strategies based on systematic selection procedures (e.g., the focal species approach) offer more compelling evidence of the usefulness of the concept. Evaluations of umbrella species schemes could be improved by including measures of population viability and data from many years, as well as by comparing the efficiency of the proposed scheme with alternative management strategies.},

  abstract = {Assessing the viability of reintroduced animal populations is a complicated task. Reintroductions are usually carried out with a small number of individuals, thereby, limiting the possibilities for monitoring because of the possible negative effects of intensive monitoring on survival and reproduction. Moreover, reintroduction studies are part of a socioeconomic interplay of forces, thereby, also limiting monitoring possibilities. Also, knowledge of population demography and abundance can be incomplete or unattainable. Here, we illustrate how we combined traditional telemetry and novel non-invasive genetic methodology to construct a detailed life table of a small reintroduced otter population in The Netherlands. Combining an appropriate capture-mark-recapture framework with a matrix modelling approach provides, in general, useful insights for such populations. The data indicated that (i) male survival is lower than female survival, (ii) the reintroduced population is currently growing (estimated λ = 1.26: range [1.06, 1.42]) and seems viable, (iii) increasing adult survival is currently the critical stage at which efforts of field managers should concentrate, and (iv) the modelling framework allowed us to determine the boundary conditions for the vital rates under which the population would go extinct. The applied approach directs at measurements that help field managers to implement the right conservation strategy after reintroductions.},

  abstract = {We review the ecological rationale behind the potential compatibility between top predators and biodiversity conservation, and examine their effectiveness as surrogate species. Evidence suggests that top predators promote species richness or are spatio-temporally associated with it for six causative or noncausative reasons: resource facilitation, trophic cascades, dependence on ecosystem productivity, sensitivity to dysfunctions, selection of heterogeneous sites and links to multiple ecosystem components. Therefore, predator-centered conservation may deliver certain biodiversity goals. To this aim, predators have been employed in conservation as keystone, umbrella, sentinel, flagship, and indicator species. However, quantitative tests of their surrogate-efficacy have been astonishingly few. Evidence suggests they may function as structuring agents and biodiversity indicators in some ecosystems but not others, and that they perform poorly as umbrella species; more consensus exists for their efficacy as sentinel and flagship species. Conservation biologists need to use apex predators more cautiously, as part of wider, context-dependent mixed strategies.},

  abstract = {Growing human-wildlife conflicts and legal conservation obligations increased the need for precise information on Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) population parameters for species status assessment and wildlife management measures. Scat surveys have become the method of choice to monitor species distribution range, abundance and habitat use. Although methodological concerns exist, scat abundance is often used as main indicator for otter population estimates and trends. To evaluate whether scat counts serve as good proxy for otter densities in linear stream habitats, we modelled the relationship between old/fresh scat abundance and otter numbers on two spatial scales, including also seasonal effects. Actual otter densities and marking behaviour were ascertained by genotyping of otter faeces collected at 218 marking sites along 132.6~km of four salmonid streams. Otter densities in our study areas ranged from 0.16 to 0.28 otters per stream kilometre. The age of scats and the level of spatial scale were determining factors when evaluating the suitability of scat abundance as index for otter densities. Covering large parts of an otter’s territory, fresh scat abundance increased with otter density, irrespectively of season. On the spatial scale of single marking sites, the relationship was not well supported, and no relationship could be found when using old scats in the models. Otter marking behaviour and differences in marking site use intensity, as well as seasonal differences in traceability and accumulation of old scats were discussed to bias the relationship between scat abundance and otter numbers.},

In eastern North America, spotted owls are absent but marten, an animal species which prefers old-growth forest, has become rare in some areas as a result of habitat loss. The marten is a threatened species in Newfoundland, exists in small numbers in Nova Scotia, and has been extirpated in Prince Edward Island. Lack of long-term integrated forest resource planning, short rotations, and silvicultural practices that produce sub-optimal habitat may eliminate the species in Atlantic Canada. Two cases are discussed from Newfoundland and New Brunswick where unbalanced forest age structures suggest a bleak future for the marten. Other larger jurisdictions in Canada should closely examine their forest land management plans in view of the Atlantic experience.},

  abstract = {The family Mustelidae is the largest among the order Carnivora. While we know a great deal about certain species, there is still a lack of information about many mustelids. We first investigated the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List species-level assessments for each mustelid species. Then, we undertook a systematic review of the scientific literature with the aim of identifying the primary threats and subthreats reported, and which species are most studied. Threats are defined by the IUCN as “the proximate human activities or processes that have impacted, are impacting, or may impact the status of the taxon”. We analysed 1003 published articles. For each article, we collected year of publication, geographical zone of each study, species studied, and the threats and subthreats identified. The majority of species (62\%) were classified as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, but 31 out of 63 species were found to be declining globally and only two species were increasing. The species studied and location of studies were biased, with 72\% of studies undertaken in North America or Europe and focussing on very few species. A high proportion of species distributed predominantly in the tropics were categorised as declining, and threats linked with hunting, fishing, and logging were identified as the most common for mustelids by the IUCN Red List and in the scientific literature. Differences in the proportion of threats affecting each subfamily were also reported. The nature of threats varies in different parts of the world and between species. It is essential to undertake more research with a strong focus towards species in highly biodiverse regions. A greater understanding of threats such as wildlife pet trade, emerging diseases, and climate change must also be central to prevent declines.},

In Chapters 4–7, we showed how to extend these methods to allow for heterogeneity, nested data, and temporal or spatial correlation structures. The resulting methods were called linear mixed modelling and additive mixed modelling (see the left hand pathway of Fig. 13.1). In Chapter 9, we introduced generalised linear modelling (GLM) and generalised additive modelling (GAM), and applied them to absence–presence data, proportional data, and count data. We used the Bernoulli and binomial distributions for 0–1 data (the 0 stands for absence and the 1 for presence), and proportional data (Y successes out of n independent trials), and we used the Poisson distribution for count data. However, one of the underlying assumptions of theses approaches (GLM and GAM) is that the data are independent, which is not always the case. In this chapter, we take this into account and extend the GLM and GAM models to allow for correlation between the observations, and nested data structures. It should come as no surprise that these methods are called generalised linear mixed modelling (GLMM) and generalised additive mixed modelling (GAMM); see the right hand pathway of Fig. 13.1.},
