  abstract = {Researchers have used occupancy, or probability of occupancy, as a response or state variable in a variety of studies (e.g., habitat modeling), and occupancy is increasingly favored by numerous state, federal, and international agencies engaged in monitoring programs. Recent advances in estimation methods have emphasized that reliable inferences can be made from these types of studies if detection and occupancy probabilities are simultaneously estimated. The need for temporal replication at sampled sites to estimate detection probability creates a trade-off between spatial replication (number of sample sites distributed within the area of interest/inference) and temporal replication (number of repeated surveys at each site). Here, we discuss a suite of questions commonly encountered during the design phase of occupancy studies, and we describe software (program GENPRES) developed to allow investigators to easily explore design trade-offs focused on particularities of their study system and sampling limitations. We illustrate the utility of program GENPRES using an amphibian example from Greater Yellowstone National Park, USA.},

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize `best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

  abstract = {Recent technological and methodological advances have revolutionized wildlife monitoring. Although most biodiversity monitoring initiatives are geared towards focal species of conservation concern, researchers are increasingly studying entire communities, specifically the spatiotemporal drivers of community size and structure and interactions among species. This has resulted in the emergence of multi-species occupancy models (MSOMs) as a promising and efficient approach for the study of community ecology. Given the potential of MSOMs for conservation and management action, it is critical to know whether study design and model assumptions are consistent with inference objectives. This is especially true for studies that are designed for a focal species but can give insights about a community. Here, we review the recent literature on MSOMs, identify areas of improvement in the multi-species study workflow, and provide a reference model for best practices for focal species and community monitoring study design. We reviewed 92 studies published between 2009 and early 2018, spanning 27 countries and a variety of taxa. There is a consistent under-reporting of details that are central to determining the adequacy of designs for generating data that can be used to make inferences about community-level patterns of occupancy, including the spatial and temporal extent, types of detectors used, covariates considered, and choice of field methods and statistical tools. This reporting bias could consequently result in skewed estimates, affecting conservation actions and management plans. On the other hand, comprehensive reporting is likely to help researchers working on MSOMs assess the robustness of inferences, in addition to making strides in terms of reproducibility and reusability of data. We use our literature review to inform a roadmap with best practices for MSOM studies, from simulations to design considerations and reporting, for the collection of new data as well as those involving existing datasets.},

  abstract = {The Eurasian otter Lutra lutra and its resting places are protected by EU and UK legislation. Consultant ecologists must identify resting sites so they can be protected during developments. Currently, consultants usually use field-signs, but radio-telemetry studies indicate this may be unreliable. Camera-traps could be used to identify resting sites within the consultancy industry. This research aims to improve field-sign and camera-trap survey methods to identify otter resting sites. Firstly, camera-trap methodology is considered. Arrays of camera-traps were used with continuous CCTV as a control so the effect of variables on detection success of mammal passes could be modelled. A six-year camera-trap study of an active breeding and resting site was analysed to optimise set-up. Distance from the camera-trap had a negative effect on trigger probability but a positive effect on registration probability (i.e. the probability that an image or video is captured given a trigger). Slower animals had greater trigger and registration probabilities while otters had reduced detection after immersion in water. A reduction of video clip duration, and exclusion of daytime monitoring would have reduced the amount of time watching video footage with minimal data loss. These findings guided a camera-trap study of 26 potential resting sites where field evidence was recorded at 21-day intervals. The camera-trap data was also used to identify rests and any relationships between resting and field evidence were investigated. A rest could only be observed on CT footage and was defined as an otter being within a structure for {$\geq$} 15min. According to this criteria, six of the 26 sites were resting sites, with 95\% of rests occurring in winter and spring. Latrines were exclusive to resting sites, and presence of bedding material was strongly related to resting sites. Data simulations calculated that a period of 35 days of camera-trapping in winter, repeated in spring would have a 95\% probability of detecting a rest. These findings contribute to the evidence-base for guidelines for ecologists to identify resting sites as required by law. The patterns of otter activity, behaviour and field-signs provide a comparison for further studies. The research focusses on otter, but the approaches and principles could be applied more widely.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

  abstract = {Monitoring and maintaining biodiversity are crucial for the ecological balance and overall health of ecosystems. Detecting anomalies in species distribution patterns is essential for identifying areas of concern and implementing timely conservation measures. This paper introduces an approach to detect anomalies in spatiotemporal species activity data by integrating time series analysis, machine learning techniques, and spatial statistics. Our method identifies distribution patterns of various species and groups regions with similar patterns, enabling the segmentation of the study area into distinct categories. Within these categorized regions, we apply a combination of clustering algorithms and outlier detection techniques to pinpoint anomalous behaviors in species distribution. In order to confirm the reliability of our findings, we cross-reference them with verified data acquired through field observations or other credible data sources. These corroborations indicate that anomalies are frequently indicative of sudden variations in species numbers or unexpected alterations in spatial distribution at certain places and times. To gain a more robust understanding of how species are distributed, we curate a data set that excludes these anomalous observations and use it to develop a predictive algorithm. Our analysis shows that a predictive model trained on this refined, anomaly-free dataset achieves a lower normalized mean square error (NMSE), which suggests a higher level of predictive accuracy as compared to a model trained on data containing anomalies. Utilizing this methodology can facilitate the creation of effective conservation plans and contribute to more sustainable ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {(Article written in French, summary in pdf) In many scientific disciplines, experimental studies or field monitoring ensure the data collection. The data is stored on raw files with an intuitive format, easily entered by the experimenter. However, this raw format is rarely directly compatible with the analysis of the collected data and the data may be erroneous; it is then necessary to carry out a formatting and quality control. Faced with the increasing number of ever more massive raw data sets, the discipline of digital for life sciences has developed. Computer programming represents a precious help for modellers since it allows the automation of data formatting and data cleaning. The data formatting makes it possible to obtain a format that will be directly used in the analyses. Automation also enables to avoid errors generated by manual formatting, such as typing errors and omissions. Data cleaning, a term used in computer science, corresponds to the data quality control according to the criteria provided by the modeller. The modeller knows the range of values of the data obtained and the possible errors produced. In this article, we present a collaboration between computer scientist and modeller in the framework of animal abundance monitoring. The data collected on several sheets of a spreadsheet had to be gathered on one sheet and their quality had to be checked. The various functionalities of the program carrying out this verification were implemented using the ``agile'' method, a computer development method consisting of sprints. After a version was provided, a new sprint defined the next functionality to be implemented by the computer scientist in a new version of the program. The first version allows the appropriation of the dataset by the computer scientist thanks to the formatting functionality. A more advanced version manages the absence of data, then others check the collected data quality and reports the processing of detected anomalies, data missing or erroneous or outside a specified range, in a text file. This computer program has been explained so that it can be re-appropriated and re-used, the full version is deposited in GitHub. The link is given in conclusion.},

We propose a model and likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when detection probabilities are 1. The model provides a flexible framework enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities (0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring program, Frog-watch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo amer-icanus), a 44\% increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed, and as 0.85 for spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.}

Failing to allow for the possibility that a target species was present, but undetected, at a site will lead to biased estimates of site occupancy, colonization, and local extinction probabilities. These population vital rates are often of interest in long-term monitoring programs and metapopulation studies. We present a model that enables direct estimation of these parameters when the probability of detecting the species is less than 1. The model does not require any assumptions of process stationarity, as do some previous methods, but does require detection/nondetection data to be collected in a manner similar to Pollock's robust design as used in mark--recapture studies. Via simulation, we show that the model provides good estimates of parameters for most scenarios considered. We illustrate the method with data from monitoring programs of Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occiden-talis caurina) in northern California and tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) in Min-nesota, USA.}

Scat surveys have become the method of choice to monitor species distribution range, abundance and habitat use. Although methodological concerns exist, scat abundance is often used as main indicator for otter population estimates and trends. To evaluate whether scat counts serve as good proxy for otter densities in linear stream habitats, we modelled the relationship between old/fresh scat abundance and otter numbers on two spatial scales, including also seasonal effects. Actual otter densities and marking behaviour were ascertained by genotyping of otter faeces collected at 218 marking sites along 132.6~km of four salmonid streams. Otter densities in our study areas ranged from 0.16 to 0.28 otters per stream kilometre. The age of scats and the level of spatial scale were determining factors when evaluating the suitability of scat abundance as index for otter densities. Covering large parts of an otter's territory, fresh scat abundance increased with otter density, irrespectively of season. On the spatial scale of single marking sites, the relationship was not well supported, and no relationship could be found when using old scats in the models. Otter marking behaviour and differences in marking site use intensity, as well as seasonal differences in traceability and accumulation of old scats were discussed to bias the relationship between scat abundance and otter numbers.},
